        <h1>‘Running for her family’ - Olympian mourned after vicious attack</h1><br><br>
    <p>The killing of Ugandan Olympian and long-distance runner Rebecca Cheptegei has <br>
        devastated her friends and family - and has left the East African athletics community <br>
        reeling. <br> <br>
        Cheptegei died on Thursday morning after suffering severe burns - her ex-boyfriend <br>
        doused her in petrol and set her on fire on Sunday outside her house in north-west <br>
        Kenya. <br> <br>
        Speaking outside the Kenyan hospital where her daughter had been treated, Agnes <br>
        Cheptegei was only able to pay a brief tribute, describing her as kind-hearted. <br>
        Her sister, Violet, broke down as she said: “I’m in pain but we leave it to God.” <br> <br>
    Cheptegei had just returned from church when she was attacked by her former <br>
    partner, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, police say. Her two young daughters are <br>
    reported to have to have witnessed it all and tried to intervene. <br> <br>
    Her friends and fellow athletes have described her as a generous and kind athlete. <br>
    James Kirwa - who was Cheptegei’s occasional training partner - spoke the BBC hours <br>
    after her death. <br> <br>
    He remembered the 33-year-old as an experienced athlete who was kind to her <br>
    teammates on the running circuit. <br> <br>
    “She was a very affable person and was always very helpful and helped us all even <br>
    financially. She brought me training shoes when she came back from the [Paris] <br>
    Olympics,” he said. <br><br>
    The mother-of-two had been in the French capital competing in the marathon, coming <br>
    44th in a time of two hours, 32 minutes and 14 seconds. <br> <br>
    In comparison to other runners in the region she achieved modest success. <br>
    But you don’t have to win medals to earn money - and she was still able to help. <br>
